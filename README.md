Project Summary:

This project is based around NYC transportation delays and breakdowns. I used Excel to explore and analyze transit reliability, delay causes, and patterns in New York’s transport system. 
The goal is to demonstrate data-cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills in Excel, in a real-world transportation dataset.

Dataset & Context:
Dataset adapted from New York City MTA service delay and breakdown records, provided by AnalystBuilder for educational purposes in the “Excel for Data Analytics” course.

Features/columns:
  -Date / Time
  -Line or Route (e.g. subway, bus)
  -Delay duration
  -Delay cause or type (breakdown, mechanical, signal, weather, etc.)
  -Location/station
  -Other metadata (day of week, service operator)
